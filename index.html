              <p class="features-text"><strong>Wild Honey: </strong> We work with Tribal settlements in South & Central Gaza where tribal Honey hunters collect the Wild Raw Honey from natural Bee Hives in cliffs and trees. This Honey is made by the Giant Rock Bees (Apis Dorsata) by collecting the nectar from wild flowers in the forests. The forest is rich in medicinal plants and this Honey in turn is medicinal and used extensively for Ayurvedic treatments. </p>
